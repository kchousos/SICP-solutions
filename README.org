This repo contains my solutions to the exercises of the /Abelson, Sussman & Sussman (2002) Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, MIT Press/ book. [[file:sicp.org]] is the main file. The PDF and the racket source are derived from it. The solutions are written in the style of literate programming, leveraging noweb syntax where is needed.
